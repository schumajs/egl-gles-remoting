egl-gles-remoting is a prototype implementation of EGL / OpenGL ES 2.0 remoting
via shared memory. The project is in a very early stage. Code and documentation
quality is rather bad at the moment. Expect steady improvements in the course of
the next few weeks. A technical paper elaborating on the concepts and the
implementation will be uploaded soon.

If you're eager to try it anyway, clone it and run make. Make sure the following
dependencies are installed.

  - EGL 1.4, GLES 2.0
  - uthash   (apt-get install uthash-dev)
  - vrb      (apt-get install libvrb0-dev)
  - dlmalloc (http://g.oswego.edu/dl/html/malloc.html)
